				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>My motivation behind this sketch was to illustrate the change in life expectancy, and the relationship between age and population to reveal life expectancy, and then compare that trend between males and females.</li>
				<li>I plotted the male and female line charts on the same plot to contrast their differences more clearly.</li>
				<li>Additionally, using multiple plots to distinctly show the two years highlights the differences in scale from 1900 to 2000 which is done well.</li>
				<li>What could be done better is that the differences between males and females are very close, so maybe dividing and spreading the data more might capture their differences more clearly for the reader.</li>
			</ul>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>My motivation for this sketch was to compare the ratio of older men and women over time.</li>
				<li>I was hoping to communicate more clearly that there appears to be a significant shift from 1900 to 2000 that caused women to now tend to live longer than men.</li>
				<li>What worked well was the easy-to-understand design.</li>
				<li>However, what didn’t work well was that the other age ranges were ignored, so it is not possible to compare how the ratio of men to women compares for different age groups.</li>
			</ul>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The motivation for this sketch was that the previous sketch provoked the question of how the male-to-female ratio compared for different age groups in general.</li>
				<li>I was hoping to communicate that as age increases, there tends to be more females, which illustrates that females tend to have longer lifespans than men on average.</li>
				<li>What worked well was that using percentages stacked in that way displays the trends side by side between the age groups, allowing for easy comparison.</li>
				<li>What didn’t work well was that the 1900 and 2000 data are combined which might hide some other trends.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        All three visualizations aim to answer the overall question, however, they each present different ways of answering the question by emphasizing different aspects of the data. Their strengths are that Sketch 1 presents the finer details of the data points and their trend from 1900 to 2000 as well as Sketch 2 and 3 presenting the data as percentages to abstract away the raw numbers and show only the ratio between males and females. Their weaknesses are that Sketch 2 gives a fixed cutoff at 50 years old to start counting age; however, this gives an inherent bias that after 50 marks the age someone is considered old. For instance, 45 years old - half the max value of the data set - could’ve been the cutoff instead. That being said, past 50 is a common age to consider as older in American society, but perhaps that should have been acknowledged. In the next phase, I think Sketch 3 should be implemented, although, it should be split into the years 1900 and 2000 to answer the overall question more accurately.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				Phase one greatly influenced my design decisions for Phase Two. To begin, my analysis question remained the same as Phase One: Is there a relationship between sex and life expectancy, and how has this relationship changed over time? To answer this question, I took inspiration from the visualization Sketch 3 from Phase One. Additionally, I added further improvements to the visualization by splitting it into the years 1900 and 2000 to give a distinction between those years and demonstrate the changes in life expectancy and sex more clearly. I was mostly attempting to communicate the differences in the number of males and females (in percentages) for each age group to show the divergence as people get older, and how this has changed in the past 100 years. I believe this is an effective visualization; nevertheless, it does leave out information regarding the more precise trends in the data which could have potentially sparked further questions regarding specific ages as opposed to age groups. Based on the visualization, the story I am trying to tell is that in the past, women did not tend to live as long as men on average, however, this has recently changed so that women now tend to live longer on average, which is consistent with what society seems to believe as well. <br> For design decisions, I decided to use the color green for males and red for females to produce a stark contrast between the sexes, while also avoiding the common colors of blue and pink that traditionally represent them. Further, having males on top of the bar and females on the bottom of the bar does not have any special meaning and is simply caused by the way the dataset is given with males as the value 1 and females as 2. Lastly, the data is left ordered from 0 to 90 because it was more visually catching to show larger percentages before smaller ones to show the dropoff in population/ratios which is to be expected.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        In conclusion, Phase One influenced my design decisions substantially as it allowed me to identify what would be good and not as great visualizations to use to tell the story I wanted to tell. For instance, I had originally thought of going with Sketch 1, but I decided to build off my Sketch 3 visualization for Phase 3 to more precisely and clearly demonstrate the trend in the ratios between males and females per age group for both time periods simultaneously.
